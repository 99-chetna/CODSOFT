#  Repository for CODSOFT Internship Task
Hello Everyone, This repository showcase my work on the projects assigned to me during my CODESOFT Internship . Here, you will be able to find a collection of tasks completed by me , each one of which help me to   enhance my skills and interest in the field of Data Science. 




##Preface 

During my Internship with CodSoft, I have been given a series of challenging and exciting tasks to work on which are very helpful in gaining more knowlegde. This repository serves as a centralized location for storing and showcasing my progress throughout the internship. Each task is stored in a separate folder to provide a comprehensive overview. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving.

##Task 1

Iris Flower Classification Description: The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. In this dataset I have used Logistic Regression Algorithm to Train and test the model. 

##Task 3

Sales Prediction using Python Description: This project focuses on Machine learning Algorithms, Accuracy and Prediction  of the Sales independtly and collectibely. It is representing Factors dat affect sale. This model not only analyize the sales of given attributes for getting the present view of sales and moreover predicts the future increment or decrement of sales.

##Task 4
