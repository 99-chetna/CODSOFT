Hello Everyone, This repository showcase my work on the projects assigned to me during my CODESOFT Internship . Here, you will be able to find a collection of tasks completed by me , each one of which help me to   enhance my skills and interest in the field of Data Science. 




Preface 

During my Internship with CodSoft, I have been given a series of challenging and exciting tasks to work on which are very helpful in gaining more knowlegde. This repository serves as a centralized location for storing and showcasing my progress throughout the internship. Each task is stored in a separate folder to provide a comprehensive overview. Each project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving.

Task 1

Titanic Survival Detection Description: This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It involves data preprocessing, data cleaning,  exploratory data analysis and building  model to predict survival probabilities. 

Task 2 

Iris Flower Classification Description: The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic machine learning task. It involves using the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. In this dataset I have used Logistic Regression Algorithm to Train and test the model. 

Task 3
